# Active Learning in NLP

The aim of this project is to identify if active learning can help in building better language models with less good quality data.

The project is undertaken as part of the Full Stack Deep Learning Course, 2021.

## Initial Plan
The initial plan is to build an end-to-end project that contains the following components,

- Active learning (using custom code or available library)
- Multi-class classification model using Transformer
- Labeling using labelstudio
- App using streamlit
- Explainability for NLP models
- Unit testing using pytest/unittest
- CI/CD using Github Actions
